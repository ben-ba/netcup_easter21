# netcup_easter21
A script to scan for easter eggs on the netcup.de website and sending out a mail if some are found

The original script was posted by mydealz user 346133 and is found here https://replit.com/repls/RelevantBluevioletGeneric
It was just extended to run every 10 minutes and to send a email if some are found
